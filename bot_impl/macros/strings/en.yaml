# {{filler}} allows automated formfilling from the message context (see bot_impl/src/tg/markdown.rs)
# available fillers include
# {{username}} - the username of the user interacting with the string
# {{first}} - the user's first name
# {{last}} - the user's last name
# {{mention}} - a telegram TextMention entity mentioning the user
# {{chatname}} - the chat the message or string was sent in
